</div>
<p class="shortdesc">If an error is caught during the message flow processing, the Error subflow is called 
and an error response is returned to the client indicating that the request was not successfully completed.</p> 
<p>If you have configured the pattern instance to enable error messages, a message is written to the error 
queue. The following actions are taken by the Error subflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Error subflow builds a SOAP fault message that is returned to the service requester indicating 
that the request was not successful. The SOAP fault includes the details of the exception that caused 
the message flow to fail.</li>
<li>If you have configured the pattern parameters to include error messages and the user-defined property: 
	<span class="msobjprop">ErrorLoggingOn</span> is selected, an error message is prepared and
	written to the error queue.
<p>Details of the exception are written as an XML message. These details include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Broker name</li>
	<li>Flow name</li>
	<li>Time stamp</li>
	<li>Status Code:
		<ul>
		<li>1 (when request has been forwarded)</li>
		<li>2 (if the provider has replied)</li>
		<li>-2 (if the provider returns a fault)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Service name</li>
	<li>Service namespace</li>
	<li>Port</li>
	<li>Port type</li>
	<li>Operation</li>
	<li>Target end point</li>
	<li>Summary of the exception data</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The summary of the exception data contains the message flow label, error number, text description, 
	and a list of inserts giving further details.</p>
</li>
