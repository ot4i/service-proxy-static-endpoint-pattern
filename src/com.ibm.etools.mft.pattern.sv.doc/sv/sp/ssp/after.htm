	<h1 class="topictitle1">Tasks to complete after generating the <span>Service Proxy: static endpoint</span> 
	pattern</h1>
	<p class="shortdesc">Tasks that you must complete after you have generated the pattern.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the broker archive (BAR) file. 
Add the generated message flow to your BAR file. In the Broker Archive editor, you must select the 
<span class="uicontrol">Compile and in-line resources</span> option before you build the BAR file.	
</li>
<li>Configure the broker archive file. Further configuration of the message flow in the broker archive file 
is not required
before you deploy the message flows for your <span>Service Proxy: static endpoint</span> pattern instance, 
but you might want to review some of the default options and configure changes for your environment.
<p>In the <span class="uicontrol">Manage</span> page of the <span class="uicontrol">Broker Archive</span> 
editor:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Optional: Use the 
	<span class="msobjprop">RequestLoggingOn</span> user-defined property to
		select whether logging requests are on or off for the message flow.</li>
	<li>Optional: Use the 
	<span class="msobjprop">ResponseLoggingOn</span> user-defined property to
		select whether logging replies are on or off for the message flow.</li>
	<li>Optional: Use the <span class="msobjprop">ErrorLoggingOn</span> 
	user-defined property to select whether
		error messages are generated.</li>
	<li>Optional: You can also change any of the configurable properties
		in the broker archive, for example, properties for security or creating
		additional instances. You must ensure that any values that you
		change do not impact the behavior of the pattern instance.</li>
	<li>If the transport defined in the WSDL file is HTTPS, 
	additional SSL configuration is required, 
		see &quot;Implementing SSL Authentication&quot; in the IBM Integration documentation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create queues. When you apply the pattern, a list of WebSphere MQ queues is generated with
queue names and queue manager names, these WebSphere MQ queues must be created if they do
not already exist. All the message settings that are required by the pattern are
set explicitly on the messages and are not dependent on queue settings.</li>
<li>In the summary file, view the list of queues that you must create. The summary file 
 		is located in the Pattern Configuration folder of the 
 		<i>InstanceName</i> pattern instance project.</li>
<li>Create <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources. You can create <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources 
either on the command line, by using programs and utilities such as <span class="cmdname">runmqsc</span>, 
or by using the <span>WebSphere MQ</span> Explorer graphical interface. 
For more information about creating 
<span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources, see <span>WebSphere MQ</span> Intercommunication,
available on the
<img src="../../../images/external_link.gif" alt="This link opens in a new window" class="external_link" /> 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/library/" target="_blank">WebSphere MQ
library web page</a>.</li>
<li>Deploy the BAR file. The message set containing the deployable WSDL must be deployed 
by using the same, or another, BAR file.
<p>The address of the proxy service is determined after deployment and is published to requesters. 
This information can be obtained by using the <span class="cmdname">mqsireportproperties</span> 
command to determine the HTTPCOnnector 
properties for the execution group.</p></li>
