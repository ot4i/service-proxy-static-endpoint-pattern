	Details about the proxy flow for the <span>Service Proxy: static endpoint</span> pattern.</p>
</div>

<p>The SimpleServiceProxy flow processes all service requests in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>When a request is received by the message flow the request is validated, 
if validation is required by the pattern instance 
configuration.</li>
<li>The message flow sets the parameters that are required to forward the service 
request to the target service provider by using the provider URL that 
is supplied in a pattern parameter or configured in the broker archive (BAR) file.</li>

<li>The SOAP request is then sent to the service provider. 
If a successful response is received, this response
is returned directly to the initiating service requester. 
If a fault message is received, the flow status is 
set to indicate that a fault has occurred and the fault message is returned to the service requester.</li>
<li>You can configure the pattern to include or exclude the logging of requests and replies. 
 </li>
<li>If logging is not included, the message flow ends successfully when the reply is returned.</li>
<li>The message flow also contains a subflow for error handling. 
</li>
<li>Error messages are written to the error queue if you have configured 
this option for your pattern instance.</li>
</ol>
